# W3C TR Pages Project

The purpose of this project is to propose and improve the the "latest versions" link headers in W3C specifications, 
and maintain and improve the style sheets for the future [TR page](https://www.w3.org/TR/) at the [W3C](http://www.w3.org/).

## Contributing

If you're familiar with GitHub then contributing is simple: just fork and make pull requests.
Absolutely everyone is welcome (and even encouraged) to contribute to improve the design of our W3C TR page.
Bugfixes, code cleanup, and simple improvements will be unilaterally approved by the W3C webmaster.
For more significant changes to the visual styles, discussion on spec-prod@w3.org is encouraged to get feedback and consensus.
(Think of it as a design critique.)

**Do not commit directly to any the common branches** (`master` and `gh-pages` at the time of writing) unless you have the approval of the W3C webmaster. Instead, fork the desired branch and submit a pull request.

## Design guidelines

See [https://github.com/w3c/tr-design/blob/gh-pages/README.md#guidelines-for-a-proper-design](Guidelines for a proper design)

## Mockups for the /TR page

* [mockup #1](https://w3c.github.io/tr-pages/mockup1/)

## Mockups for an outdated (deprecated) specification

* Outdated:
  * [HTML 4](https://w3c.github.io/tr-pages/outdatedspecsmockup/html4/)
  * [HTML ARIA](https://w3c.github.io/tr-pages/outdatedspecsmockup/html-aria/)

Note that we have different styles for rescinded and obsoleted specifications. See our [https://github.com/w3c/tr-design](TR design project) for those.
