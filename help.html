  <h1>Search Criteria</h1>
  </div>
<p>This page describes the search criteria available in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/">https://www.w3.org/TR/</a>.</p>

<h3 id='title'>Search by title</h3>

<p>This does a simple text matching on titles of specifications.</p>

<h3 id='tag'>Search by tags</h3>

<p>
  We add a limited set of tags to our documents based on general topics that we believe are most relevant for our general community.
</p>

<h3 id="status">Search by Status</h3>

<p>
  This matches the status of the Document, as defined by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/">W3C Process</a>.
  W3C Recommendations have gone through the entire review cycle and are endorsed by the W3C Director. Retired documents are obsoleted,
  superseded, or abandoned.
</p>

<h3 id='version'>Search by Version</h3>

<p>
  This narrows down the list to a more useful list of documents based on their status. Depending on your needs, you may choose between:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Latest: the most stabilized documents known for a given technology. Use this if you're looking to deploy the technology in documents/applications;</li>
  <li>Upcoming: the "tip" of the document, as approved by a W3C Group. Use this if you're interested in being on the leading edge;</li>
  <li>Editor's draft: list all known drafts with the latest edits from the editor. Depending on the work style of the Group, those edits may or may not
    be approved by the Group. Use this if you're an implementor and looking to know the latest thinking.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>More information on the version classification can be found in <a href="https://www.w3.org/2005/05/tr-versions#shortnames">3. Short Names and canonical URLs</a>.</p>
